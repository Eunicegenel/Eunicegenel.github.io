		  	<p class="lifePaths1">Harland David Sanders was born on September 9, 1890, in a four-room house located 3 miles (5 km) east of Henryville, Indiana. He was the oldest of three children born to Wilbur David and Margaret Ann (née Dunlevy) Sanders.</p>
		  	<br>
		  	<p class="dateLine2"><span class="detes">life in the Military...</span> &nbsp &nbsp1906</p>
		  	<p class="lifePaths2">Sanders falsified his date of birth and enlisted in the United States Army in October 1906, completing his service commitment as a wagoner (see teamster) in Cuba. He was honorably discharged in February 1907 and moved to Sheffield, Alabama, where his uncle lived.</p>
		  	<br>
		  	<p class="dateLine1">1924 &nbsp &nbsp <span class="detes">to the land of Origin...</span></p>
		  	<p class="lifePaths1">Sanders moved to Winchester, Kentucky, to work as a salesman for the Michelin Tire Company. He lost his job in 1924 when Michelin closed its New Jersey manufacturing plant.</p>
		  	<br>
		  	<p class="dateLine2"><span class="detes">start of the Legend...</span> &nbsp &nbsp1930</p>
		  	<p class="lifePaths2">In 1930, the Shell Oil Company offered Sanders a service station in North Corbin, Kentucky, rent free, in return for paying the company a percentage of sales. Sanders began to serve chicken dishes and other meals such as country ham and steaks. Initially he served the customers in his adjacent living quarters before opening a restaurant.</p>
		  	<br>
		  	<p class="dateLine1">1935 &nbsp &nbsp <span class="detes">Recognition...</span></p>
		  	<p class="lifePaths1">Sanders was commissioned as a Kentucky colonel in 1935 by Kentucky governor Ruby Laffoon. His local popularity grew, and, in 1939, food critic Duncan Hines visited Sanders's restaurant and included it in Adventures in Good Eating, his guide to restaurants throughout the US.</p>

		  	<p class="pImg">After being recommissioned as a Kentucky colonel in 1950 by Governor Lawrence Wetherby, Sanders began to dress the part, growing a goatee and wearing a black frock coat (later switching to a white suit), a string tie, and referring to himself as "Colonel".<br><br>He never wore anything else in public during the last 20 years of his life, using a heavy wool suit in the winter and a light cotton suit in the summer. He bleached his mustache and goatee to match his white hair.</p>
